# Good Data Visualisation with R - Session 2

The second session focusses on some principles for using data visualisation in research. A more freeform practical exercise with example data is then offered, and attendees can attempt to replicate and improve visualisations. This covers processes that include: 

* Different types of plots and when and where each might be best used 

* The pitfalls of misleading data visualisation 

* Introduction to some more advanced visualisation possibilities 

We will also cover some basic data manipulation, so that you have the tools to get the most out of your data.

## Getting started

So lets's get going! But before we get plotting, we will first inspect our data and understand what it is we might want to plot. 

For the majority of this session, we will be working the Palmer Penguins data set (https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/tree/main). Think of it as the next step up for the Iris that we worked with last week ;)

```{r penguins}

?penguins
summary(penguins)
head(penguins)
```

![The Penguins](lter_penguins.png)

Last week we focused mostly on plotting numeric Vs numeric data. But sometimes we categorically have to consider categories. This opens up whole new avenues and options for us, as we can start to consider representing percentages, means, medians, counts, and a whole bunch of other scenarios. We can also use the grammar approach of ggplot to layer different visualisations. Today we will be looking at our penguin dataset to compare between species, island and sex, and how these relate to penguin bodyweight. Let's have a look through our examples below:

```{r example plots}

#bar charts

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = species, fill = species )) +
  geom_bar() 

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island, fill = species )) +
  geom_bar() 

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island, fill = species )) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") 
```


```{r}
#boxplots

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g )) +
  geom_boxplot() #boxplot

## We can also combine our geometries
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g )) +
  geom_violin(aes(color = species), fill = "grey5", alpha = .7) +
   geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y",
               stackdir = "center",
               dotsize = 0.5,
               alpha = .7, 
               color = "white",
               aes(fill = species))+
  geom_boxplot(width = .5, alpha = .4) # alpha = transparency of item, width = width of item
```

```{r}
## Or we can engage with Multi-group faceting
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = sex )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~island)

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g , fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(~island ~sex) +
  coord_flip()

 ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island, fill = species )) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
   facet_wrap(~sex)

```

Using the plots above, answer the following questions:

 * Which penguin species looks to be heaviest?
 * Which sex of penguin tends to be heaviest?
 * Which island has the "biggest bois" of Adeile penguins?

## Bonus missing detour 

Notice how this gives us a visualisation of our NA - we can supplement this with the naniar package if we want to better understand our missing variables

```{r missing visualisation}
library(naniar)

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g )) +
  geom_miss_point( position = "jitter") + # used to visualise missing data
  geom_boxplot( alpha = .7) + # using "alpha" to create a transparent boxplot
  facet_grid(~island ~sex)
### So which species and in which island are there missing values?
```

## Summarised statistics and data vis 

In the visualisations above, we have relied on the raw numbers. However, there are times when we need to perform our visualisations with some additional calculations. We might want to to share information about the total, maybe to compare the average across a population, or maybe percentages within in a population. 

To do so, we will need use some data wrangling to help create some data vis. Thankfully the Tidyverse functions make this nice and easy. 

```{r summarised_stats}

penguins %>% 
  group_by(island, species, sex ) %>%  # grouping by category # the hierarchy is important here
  na.omit() %>% # be careful of removing na - this is just for a quick example
  summarise(sum = sum(body_mass_g), # summarised stats
            min = min(body_mass_g),
            max = max(body_mass_g),
            median = median(body_mass_g),
            sd = sd(body_mass_g),
            mean = mean(body_mass_g)) %>%
  ggplot( aes(
    x = species, y = sum, fill = sex
  )) +
 geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  # geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = min, ymax = max), position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~island) # +
  coord_flip()

```

## Plotting purely categorical data
For this we will be relying on counts and percentages to provide the numbers needed. Again this will require some initial data wrangling.

```{r}  
  penguin_count <- penguins %>%
    count(species) %>% 
    mutate(percentage_p = n/nrow(penguins))
head(penguin_count)

```

### The dreaded pie char

```{r}  
  ggplot(penguin_count, aes(x = "", 
                       y = percentage_p, fill = species)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
    coord_polar("y", start=0) + 
    geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(percentage_p, 3))), 
  position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
    theme_void()

```

The pie chart is dreaded because:

 * Can be difficult to compare values
 * Can be difficult to interpret trends in values
 
 These issues may not be problematic when faced with simple outputs and small numbers of categories, but can become overwhelming/messy when we expand our categories.
 
``` {r}
 
 island_count <- penguins %>% 
  filter(sex != "NA") %>% 
      group_by(island, species, sex) %>% 
      summarise( n = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n))
    head(island_count, 10)

    ggplot(island_count, aes(x = "", 
                              y = percent, fill = sex)) + 
      geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
      coord_polar("y", start=0) + 
      geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(percent, 3))), 
                position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
      facet_wrap(~island~species) +
    theme_void()

```

### Alternatives to pie chart - bar charts 

```{r}    
    ggplot(island_count, aes(x = species, 
                             y = percent, 
                             fill = island)) + 
      geom_bar(stat="identity", 
               position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
    
    ggplot(island_count, aes(x = reorder(species, percent), 
                              y = percent,
                              fill = species)) + 
      geom_bar(stat="identity", 
               position = "dodge") + 
      geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(percent, 3))),
                position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
      labs(x= "Species",
           y = "Percentage %") +
      coord_cartesian(ylim = c(.48, .52)) +
      facet_wrap(~sex ~island )
    
 
    
```

### Comparing groups within populations

```{r}    
    penguins %>% 
    group_by(island, species) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% na.omit() %>%
ggplot( aes(x = reorder(island, n), 
                            y = n,
                            fill = species)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", 
             position = "dodge") + 
      geom_text(aes(label = n, vjust = -.5), position = position_dodge(width = .9)) +
      labs(x= "species",
           y = "n")

```
  
### Simplifying/de cluttering plot - dumbbell plot


```{r}
    penguins %>% 
      group_by( island, species) %>% 
      summarise(n = n()) %>% na.omit() %>%
      ggplot( aes(x = reorder(island, n), 
                  y = n,
                 )) + 
      geom_line(aes(group = island)) + # creating line in between the point for each island
     geom_point(aes(color = species), size = 10) +# colouring each point by the species 
  geom_text(aes(label = n, vjust = .5), size = 3) +
  #facet_wrap(~sex) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 150)) +
      coord_flip() +
  labs(color = "",
       x = "Island",
       y = "Number of Penguins",
       title = "Penguin Distribution Plot") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)+
  theme(legend.position = "left")

```

### Working with data with many categories
 
 
Here we will be working with mpg dataset - as it contains a higher number of categories.

Our aim is to find out which brand has the highest mpg. Our first step is to tidy the data. Our second will be to create a treemap to visualise the data.

```{r}
#instal.packages("treemapify")
   library(treemapify)  
    ?mpg
    head(mpg)
    summary(mpg)
       
data <- mpg %>% mutate(
  manufacturer = as.factor(manufacturer),
  model = as.factor(model)
) %>% group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  arrange(avg_hwy)
data
```

```{r}
  ggplot(data, aes(fill = avg_hwy, area = avg_hwy, label = manufacturer )) +
  geom_treemap() +
  geom_treemap_text(colour = "white",
                    place = "centre",
                    size = 10,
                    grow = TRUE) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c()
```   

### Task time 

Now that we have identified the most efficent brand of car, can we find the most efficient car model?

```{r}

  data <- mpg %>% mutate(
    manufacturer = as.factor(manufacturer),
    model = as.factor(model)
  ) %>% group_by(model) %>%
    summarise(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>%
  arrange(avg_hwy)
  data
```

```{r}
  ggplot(data, aes(fill = avg_hwy, area = avg_hwy, label = model )) +
    geom_treemap() +
    geom_treemap_text(colour = "white",
                      place = "centre",
                      size = 5,
                      grow = TRUE) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c()


```

### Now to examine differences between 1999 and 2008

```{r}
  
  data <- mpg %>% mutate(
    manufacturer = as.factor(manufacturer),
    model = as.factor(model),
    year = as.factor(year)
  ) %>% group_by(year, manufacturer) %>%
    summarise(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  arrange(avg_hwy)
  data
  summary(data)
```

```{r}
  ggplot(data, aes(fill = avg_hwy, area = avg_hwy, label = manufacturer )) +
    geom_treemap() +
    geom_treemap_text(colour = "white",
                      place = "centre",
                      size = 5,
                      grow = TRUE) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c() +
    facet_wrap(~year)
  
```  

So we were able to show off... but maybe the treeplot is too complex. It makes it hard to track differences. Time to go back to our dumbbell plot! 
  
```{r}

ggplot(data, aes(x = reorder(manufacturer, avg_hwy), 
              y = avg_hwy)) + 
    geom_line(aes(group = manufacturer)) + # creating line in between the point for each manufacturer
    geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 6) + # colouring each point by the year
    geom_text(aes(label = round(avg_hwy, 0)), size = 2) + # adding values to each point
    labs(x = "",
         y = "average miles per galon (mpg) on highway",
         title = "Tracking vehicle effficency across different manufacturers",
         color = "") +
     coord_flip() +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

* Which manufacturer was least efficient in 1999?
* Which manufacturer lost efficiency between 1999 and 2008?
* Which car has made the largest improvements in efficiency?



*****

### Data preparation
This example will use the `starwars` dataset. Lets inspect the data before we move on. 

```{r}
?starwars 
unique(starwars$homeworld)
head(starwars)
summary(starwars)
```

Let's say we want to plot the proportion of each homeworld in starwars. Our first step is to perform some data manipulation using our trusty tidyverse tools.

 We can also run our calculations inside ggplot if needed - here using the after_stat() function.

```{r}
ggplot(starwars, aes(y = homeworld, x = after_stat(count / sum(count)))) +
  geom_bar()

```

As we can see, this is a little overwhelming. So lets do some data wrangling to simplify the data

```{r}
strwrs<- starwars %>% select(homeworld) %>% #we are only interested in species 
  mutate(homeworld = as.factor(homeworld)) %>% # mutating to factor
  group_by(homeworld) %>%  #grouping
  summarise(prop = n()/nrow(starwars)) %>%  # creating proportion label
  mutate(
         homeworld = forcats::fct_reorder(homeworld,prop, .desc = TRUE) #ordering data
         ) %>% filter(prop > .015,
           homeworld != "NA") %>% 
  arrange(prop)# 
head(strwrs)
summary(strwrs$homeworld)

```

# Step 2 - creating a basic bar chart
## here we will feed our data manipulation from the previous step straight into ggplot to create a bar chart which communicates the proportion of diamond cuts visually.

```{r}
plot <- strwrs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x =prop, y = homeworld)) + #adding the ggplot to select our variables (we can play with x and y alignment here),
  geom_col() # using geom_col() to create our bar chart.

plot

```

In our bar chart, we can customise the axes. Have a think about which is most effective at communicating our data clearly. I prefer having categorical variables on the y axis, as it makes easier to read the category names, and makes it easier to vertically compare the proportions.

### Step 3 - Adding some style to the visualisation.

At the moment, our plot is very functional. It communicates our data, and allows for comparisons between cuts (as we want). However there are some features that need improving - our labels are messy, and the decimal system of proportion can be confusing for some. Plus the overall visual style is a little dry and off putting. 

So lets address this in two stages - 1st by playing with the lables. And 2nd by playing with the theme.

### Step 3a - updating labels.

```{r}
plot_2 <- plot +
  scale_x_continuous( # scale_x_continuous() for manipulating the x axis.
    expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, .13), # Setting limits to min and max ranges
    labels = scales::label_percent(), # converting proportion to %
    name = "Percentage" # Renaming x axis to "Proportion"
  ) 

plot_2

```

### Step 3b - Setting a default theme and updating the theme

```{r}
theme_set(theme_minimal()) # Setting theme - change this back to theme if need to set back to default

theme_update( # updating/customising the theme
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
  axis.line.x = element_line(color = "grey80", linewidth = .4),
  axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = "grey80", linewidth = .4),
  axis.title.y = element_blank(), # using element blank to remove the y label
  plot.margin = margin(10, 15, 10, 15)
)

plot_2
```

## Step 4 -placing category labels on top of each bar

So now we have a tidy plot, with some clearer visuals. But we still have some steps left to improve. Our first step will be play with the category labels so that they hover above their corresponding bar. This will be done with faceting.

```{r}
plot_2 + 
  facet_wrap(~homeworld)
```

We see that this has most definitely made things worse. But have some faith! We can make some minor adjustments to the facet command to get closer to what we want. Here we set the ncols to 1 (so it's stored in one column), and set scales to "free_y" so that our y axis is clearer. free_y will free the axis range, and remove redundant empty groups - which provides additional white space.

```{r}
plot_2 +
  facet_wrap(~ homeworld, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")

```

Our next step is to clean the y axis labels - we will also bold the text on the labelled data.

```{r}
plot_3 <- plot_2 +
  facet_wrap(~ homeworld, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")  +
  scale_y_discrete(
    guide = "none", # using this to remove y label 
    expand = expansion(add = c(.7, .1)) # Used to add space between bars and the x axis
  ) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(
    hjust = 0, margin = margin(1, 0, 1, 0), 
    size = rel(1.1), face = "bold"
  ))

plot_3
```

### Adding percentage labels to plot 

```{r}
plot_4 <- plot_3 +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = paste0("  ", # setting a blank space at start of label
                       sprintf("%0.1f", #setting decimal places and sum
                               prop * 100),
                       "%  "), # setting symbol, and space at end of label
        color = prop > .03, # setting colour rule for prop values greater than .03
        hjust = prop > .03), # setting horizontal rule for prop values greater than .03
    size = 4, fontface = "bold" # setting font size and "bold"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("black", "white"), # setting colours for rules set above
    guide = "none") # removing colour legend

plot_4
```

### Selectively colouring/highlighting top and bottom ranked categories 

Here we are going back to our original plot code to customise the the geom_col() command. We will also add a new scale_fill_manual() command to customise the fill colour choices.

```{r}
fancy_plot <- starwars %>% select(homeworld) %>% #we are only interested in species 
  mutate(homeworld = as.factor(homeworld)) %>% # mutating to factor
  group_by(homeworld) %>%  #grouping
  summarise(prop = n()/nrow(starwars)) %>%  # creating proportion label
  mutate(
    homeworld = forcats::fct_reorder(homeworld,prop, .desc = TRUE) #ordering data
  ) %>% filter(prop > .02,
               homeworld != "NA")  %>% 
 mutate(col = case_when( # using case_when to set color rules to proportion
   prop == max(prop) ~ "green4",
   prop == min(prop) ~ "red4",
   prop > min(prop) & prop <max(prop) ~ "gray60"
 ),
 cut = forcats::fct_reorder(homeworld, prop, .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x =prop, y = homeworld, fill = col)) + #here specifying we want color set by our colour rules
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = paste0(" ", sprintf("%0.1f",prop * 100), "%  "), 
        color = prop > .10,  #changed rule
        hjust = prop > .10), #changed rule
    size = 4, fontface = "bold"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous( 
    expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, .13),  
    labels = scales::label_percent(), 
    name = "Proportion" 
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("black", "white"),
    guide = "none") +
  scale_fill_identity(guide = "none") + # Setting guide to "none" to remove legend
  facet_wrap(~ cut, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")+
  scale_y_discrete(guide = "none", 
    expand = expansion(add = c(.6, .01)) 
  ) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(
    hjust = 0, margin = margin(1, 0, 1, 0), 
    size = rel(1.1), face = "bold"
  ))+
   labs(title = "Our Pretty Barchart - Starwars Homeplanets")
  
fancy_plot
```



## Playtime for consolidation again!  This time with the diamonds dataset (Answers below)

```{r}
  ?diamonds
  summary(diamonds)
  
  # Plot 1 - average price of each cut
  
  diamonds %>% 
    group_by(...) %>%
    summarise(mean_price = mean(price)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x= reorder(...,mean_price)
               , y = ...)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill = cut))
```  

```{r}  
  # Plot 2 - average price of each colour of diamond within each cut
  
  diamonds %>% 
    group_by(cut, ...) %>%
    summarise(mean_depth = mean(...)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x= reorder(cut,mean_depth),
               y = mean_depth)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill = ...), position = "dodge") 
```

```{r}
  # Plot 3 - What is the proportion of each cut?
  
  diamond_prop <- diamonds %>%
    count(...) %>% 
    mutate(percentage_cut = n/nrow(diamonds))
  head(diamond_prop)
  
  ggplot(diamond_prop, aes(x = ...(... , percentage_cut), # think about whether reordering is useful here... (but also compare with and without)
                            y = percentage_cut,
                            fill = ...)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", 
             position = "...") 
 
  # How many of each color is there for each cut? (column chart and dumbbell  - which is best for this dataset?)
```

```{r}
  # Column chart  
  diamonds %>%
