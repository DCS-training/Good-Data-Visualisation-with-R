# Good Data Visualisation with R - Session 2

The second session focusses on some principles for using data visualisation in research. A more freeform practical exercise with example data is then offered, and attendees can attempt to replicate and improve visualisations. This covers processes that include: 

* Different types of plots and when and where each might be best used 

* The pitfalls of misleading data visualisation 

* Introduction to some more advanced visualisation possibilities 

We will also cover some basic data manipulation, so that you have the tools to get the most out of your data.

I recommend the Fundamentals of [Data Visualization by Claus O. Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) for further tips on using data visualisation as a communication tool. It covers useful tips, tricks, and pitfalls to avoid. 

## Getting started

So lets's get going! But before we get plotting, we will first inspect our data and understand what it is we might want to plot. 

For the majority of this session, we will be working the Palmer Penguins data set (https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/tree/main). 

```{r penguins}

?penguins
summary(penguins)
head(penguins)
```

Last week we focused mostly on plotting numeric Vs numeric data. But sometimes we categorically have to consider categories. 

This opens up whole new avenues and options for us, as we can start to consider representing percentages, means, medians, counts, and a whole bunch of other scenarios. 

We can also use the grammar approach of ggplot to layer different visualisations. Today we will be looking at our penguin dataset to compare between species, island and sex, and how these relate to penguin bodyweight. We will start off with bar charts.

## Bar Charts

Nice, simple bar charts.... Bar charts are used to communicate count values and proportion values. Let's have a look at the different options we might have of presenting count and proportion values

We have 3 main choices:
* Stacked - the count data is stacked vertically in the bars.
* Dodged - the count data is placed horizontally next to each other, in "dodged" bars.
* Filled - the data is converted to a % value. The columns will range from 0% to 100%. Making it very useful to compare proportions of count data.


```{r example plots}

#bar charts

## Default stack option - values are stacked on each other
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island, fill = species )) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") 

## Dodge position - the values are put side by side (i.e., they are dodged)
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island, fill = species )) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") 

## Fill position - where values are converted to proportional %
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island, fill = species )) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") 


```

### Task time : Bar charts for histograms

We can also use bar charts to create histograms. This is because the bar chart uses count values to communicate the data. 

Try it yourselves! In the code chunks below, replace `x = island`, with `x = body_mass_g` and see what you get in each of the 3 position options. 

```{r task plots}

#bar charts

## Default stack option - values are stacked on each other
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island, fill = species )) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") 

## Dodge position - the values are put side by side (i.e., they are dodged)
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island, fill = species )) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") 

## Fill position - where values are converted to proportional %
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island, fill = species )) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") 


```

Now let's make sense of these plots! 

What do we think is being communicated in each of the 3 options?

Under what circumstances would we use these options?



## Column charts

The counterpart to the bar chart,
focuses on the column part. 

The column chart is used when we want the height of the bars to represent values in the data. I tend to prefer using this option after doing some manual data wrangling (i.e., to calculate mean values). However, it is very effective at communicating the maximum values in our data when used without wrangling.


Once again, we have the options to *stack*, *fill*, or *dodge* our values.

### Geom columns without wrangling.

```{r}
## stacked
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes( x= island,
            y = body_mass_g,
            fill = species )) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") #

## dodged
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes( x= island,
            y = body_mass_g,  
            fill = species )) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") 

## filled
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes( x= island,
            y = body_mass_g,
            fill = species)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") 

```

### Reflection tasks 

* How effective were these charts are communicating the data? 

* Under what circumstances would you choose the *stack*, *dodge*, or *fill options* for bar charts?

* Under what circumstances would you choose the *stack*, *dodge*, or *fill options* for columns charts?


## Boxplots

Boxplots are useful when we want to visually communicate the distributions of a continuous variable within our data. We can also split it by categorical variables if it is important to us. Boxplots help go beyond the data communicated in the column charts, as they can represent more than just the peak of the data - they can do so much more.

The boxplot is used to visualise 4 summary statistics within our chosen variables:
* The median - the horizontal line in the boxplot.

* The interquartile range - this is represented by the *box* of the boxplot. The upper part of the box is the 75th percentile, whilst the lower part of the box represents the 25th percentile. 

* The whiskers - the whiskers extend from the box to value of 1.5 * the interquartile range.

* Data beyond the the whiskers (outside 1.5 * the interquartile range) are considered to be "outlying" points. This can help us researchers identify if there is the presence of influential outliers.

* We can also use the whiskers and/or the outliers to determine the minimum and maximum values in our data.

Below, we will communicate our stats across the differnt position arguments.

```{r}

# default boxplot (this is "dodge2")
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island,
           y = body_mass_g,
           fill = species )
       ) +
  geom_boxplot( alpha = .7)

# position set to dodge
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island,
           y = body_mass_g,
           fill = species )
       ) +
  geom_boxplot(position = "dodge", alpha = .7)

# position set to identity
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = island,
           y = body_mass_g,
           fill = species )
       ) +
  geom_boxplot(position = "identity", alpha = .7)



```

# Task time

Make some plots in the code chunks below to help you answer the following questions:

 * Which penguin species is heaviest?
 * Which sex of penguin tends to be heaviest?
 * Which island has the lightest Adeile penguins?
 
```{r}

```


## Bonus - visualising something that's missing

Notice how this gives us a visualisation of our NA - we can supplement this with the naniar package if we want to better understand our missing variables

```{r missing visualisation}


ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(y = body_mass_g ,x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_miss_point( position = "jitter") + # used to visualise missing data
  facet_wrap(~sex)
### So which species and in which island are there missing values?
```

## Summarised statistics and data vis 

In the visualisations above, we have relied on the raw numbers. However, there are times when we need to perform our visualisations with some additional calculations. We might want to to share information about the total, maybe to compare the average across a population, or maybe percentages within in a population. 

To do so, we will need use some data wrangling to help create some data vis. Thankfully the Tidyverse functions make this nice and easy. 

```{r summarised_stats}

penguins %>% 
  group_by(island, species ) %>%  # grouping by category # the hierarchy is important here
  na.omit() %>% # be careful of removing na without inital checks
  summarise(sum = sum(body_mass_g), # summarised stats
            min = min(body_mass_g),
            max = max(body_mass_g),
            median = median(body_mass_g),
            sd = sd(body_mass_g),
            mean = mean(body_mass_g)) %>%
  ggplot( aes(
    x = species, y = mean , color = species
  )) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = min, ymax = max), linewidth = 1.8) +
   geom_point(size = 4, color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~island) 

```

## Plotting purely categorical data
For this we will be relying on counts and percentages to provide the numbers needed. Again this will require some initial data wrangling.

### The dreaded pie chart

To make the pie chart, we need to do some customising.

The plot starts with some initial data wrangling to create our percentage values needed for the pie chart.

The base layer is the geom_bar, as we are using count/proportion data. The position this time is set to "identity".

From there, we use the coord_polar to convert the chart to polar coordinates. First we set the theta to "y", so that R can identify the axis to map the angles to. 

We're combining the plot with text this time, to address on the limitations of pie charts - in that the proportions are difficult to estimate. So we'll use `geom_text()` to provide our value labels. 

Finally, `theme_void()` is used to declutter the space of the pie chart.

```{r}  
  
penguins %>%
    count(species) %>% 
    mutate(percentage_p = n/nrow(penguins)) %>%
ggplot( 
  aes(x = "", y = percentage_p, fill = species)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
    coord_polar(theta = "y") + 
    geom_text(
      aes(label = scales::percent(round(percentage_p, 3))), 
  position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
    theme_void()

```

The pie chart is dreaded because:

 * Can be difficult to compare values
 * Can be difficult to interpret trends in values
 
 These issues may not be problematic when faced with simple outputs and small numbers of categories, but can become overwhelming/messy when we expand our categories.
 
``` {r}
 
penguins %>% 
  filter(sex != "NA") %>% 
      group_by(island, species, sex) %>% 
      summarise( n = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n)) %>%
    ggplot(
      aes(x = "", y = percent, fill = sex)) + 
      geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
      coord_polar("y") + 
      geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(percent, 3))), 
                position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
      facet_wrap(~island~species, nrow = 1) +
    theme_void()

```

### Alternatives to pie chart - bar charts 

```{r}    

penguins %>% 
  filter(sex != "NA") %>% 
      group_by(island, species, sex) %>% 
      summarise( n = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n)) %>%
    ggplot(
      aes(x = species, y = percent, fill = sex)) + 
      geom_bar(stat="identity", 
               position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~island)
```

### Comparing groups within populations

```{r}    
    penguins %>% 
    group_by(island, species) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% na.omit() %>%
ggplot( aes(x = reorder(island, n), 
                            y = n,
                            fill = species)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", 
             position = "dodge2") + 
      geom_text(aes(label = n, vjust = -.5), position = position_dodge(width = .9)) +
      labs(x= "species",
           y = "n")

```
  
### Simplifying/de cluttering plot - dumbbell plot

We can take the visualisation of categorical variables a step further, by using the dumbbell plot. 

The dumbbell plot places a point on the corresponding value. We also connect a line between these points, to show their connections. As an extra, we're also labelling the value inside each end of the dumbbell.

From there we can facet wrap to split our data by a third variable. 

Then we play with the coordinates to maximise the communication of the data. We rescale the values of the y axis being displayed to have a nice zoomed in view. We also use the `coordflip()` to flip the axes around.

The plot finishes with its labelling and theme choices. 

The end result is a decluttered plot which

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
    penguins %>% 
      group_by( island, species, sex) %>% 
      summarise(n = n()) %>% na.omit() %>%
      ggplot( aes(x = reorder(sex, n), 
                  y = n,
                 )) + 
      geom_line(aes(group = sex)) + # creating line in between the point for each sex
     geom_point(aes(color = species), # colouring each point by the species
                size = 10, alpha = .7 ) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = n, vjust = .5), size = 3) + # labelling values
  facet_wrap(~island, nrow = 3) + # faceting and choosing number of rows
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 75)) + # changing the scale of values displayed
      coord_flip() + # flipping the coordinates
  labs(color = "", #labelling
       x = "Island",
       y = "Number of Penguins",
       title = "Penguin Distribution Plot") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```



## Tasktime   

We are going to try and recreate the plot from above, but with the diamonds dataset. 

Your goal is to make a plot that communicates the mean value of the sale prices of different cuts of diamonds. So you will want to focus on the `cut` and `price` variables from the diamonds dataset.

If you run out of time, or you want to work on this in your own space, we have included the solutions at the end of the worksheet.

### Plot 1 - Can we plot the average price of each cut?
```{r}
  ?diamonds # To get the metadata
  summary(diamonds) # to help identify variable names
  
  
  
  
```  

### Plot 2 - Can we plot the average price of each colour of diamond within each cut
```{r}  

  

```

### Plot 3 - Can we plot to find the proportion of each cut within the data?
```{r}
  
  
```
 
### Plot 4 - How many of each color is there for each cut? (column chart and dumbbell  - which is best for this dataset?)

#### 4a. Column chart 
```{r}
 
 
```

#### 4b. Dumbell Chart
```{r}

```


### Plot 5 - What if reviewer 2 is being silly, and wants us to plot proportions by cut, by color, and by clarity?.
```{r}

  

```

### Plot 6 - Can we make a plot to compare the mean price across cut, color and clarity of diamonds?
```{r}

  
  
  
```  

## Solutions to challenges above

### Plot 1 - Can we plot the average price of each cut?
```{r}

  diamonds %>% 
    group_by(cut) %>%
    summarise(mean_price = mean(price)) %>%
    arrange(desc(mean_price)) %>%
    ggplot(
      aes(x= reorder(cut, -mean_price) # this is an extra trick to reorder the plot.
               , y = mean_price)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill = cut))
  
```


### Plot 2 - Can we plot the average price of each colour of diamond within each cut
```{r}

  
  diamonds %>% 
    group_by(cut, color) %>%
    summarise(mean_price = mean(price)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x= reorder(cut, mean_price),
               y = mean_price)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill = color), position = "dodge") 
```

### Plot 3 - Can we plot to find the proportion of each cut within the data?
```{r}

  
  diamonds %>%
    count(cut) %>% 
    mutate(percentage_cut = n/nrow(diamonds)) %>%
   ggplot(
     aes(x = reorder(cut, percentage_cut), 
         y = percentage_cut,
         fill = cut)
     ) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", 
             position = "dodge")

### OR the dreaded pie chart option ;)

  diamonds%>%
    count(cut) %>% 
    mutate(percentage_p = n/nrow(diamonds)) %>%
ggplot( 
  aes(x = "", y = percentage_p, fill = cut)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
    coord_polar(theta = "y") + 
    geom_text(
      aes(label = scales::percent(round(percentage_p, 3))), 
  position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
    theme_void() +
    theme(legend.position = "top")

```


### Plot 4 - How many of each color is there for each cut? (column chart and dumbbell  - which is best for this dataset?)

#### 4a. Column chart
```{r}


  # Column chart  
  diamonds %>% 
    group_by( cut, color) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% na.omit() %>%
    ggplot( aes(x = reorder(cut, n), 
                y = n
    )) + 
    geom_col(position = "dodge", aes(fill = color)) +
    coord_flip() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```

#### 4a. Dumbbell chart
```{r}
 
  diamonds %>% 
    group_by( cut, color) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% na.omit() %>%
    ggplot( aes(x = reorder(cut, n), 
                y = n
    )) + 
    geom_line(aes(group = cut)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = color), size = 5, alpha = .7) +
   geom_text(aes(label = color)) +
    coord_flip() +
    theme(legend.position = "") 
```

             aes(fill = color)) +
    coord_flip() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    facet_wrap(~clarity, ncol = 4)
```


### Plot 6 - Can we make a plot to compare the mean price across cut, color and clarity of diamonds?
```{r}

  
  diamonds %>% 
    group_by( cut, color, clarity) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(),
              mean_price = mean(price)) %>% na.omit() %>%
    ggplot( aes(x = reorder(color, -mean_price), 
                y = mean_price
    )) + 
    geom_col(position = "dodge", aes(fill = color)) +
    theme(legend.position = "top",
          axis.text.y=element_blank(),
          axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),
          axis.title.y=element_blank()) +

  guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 7, # changing the legend
                             title.position = "top",
                             title.hjust =0.5))
  
```
